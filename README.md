# Example of automating Azure Privileged Identity Management Role Settings for Azure Resources

The goal of this repo is to provide examples of how to automate the configuration of Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) Role Settings for Azure Resources.

When assisting a customer with automating configuration of PIM role settings for Azure Resources, I struggled to locate any concrete examples or sample code. This was most likely due to the [PIM APIs being in public preview and not GA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-apis).

Documentation to configure the role settings manually for an Azure Resource can be located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-configure-role-settings).
